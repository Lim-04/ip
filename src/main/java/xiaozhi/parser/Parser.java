/**

 * <p>
 * Only checks that a command is syntactically well-formed (e.g. that a
 * deadline has a {@code /by} date, or that a task number is a number at
 * all); whether that task number actually exists is left to the resulting
 * command's own {@code execute()}, since only it has access to the task list.
 * <p>
 * The character(s) that separate the command word from the rest of the line
 * (and any run of extra spaces a user might type there) are collapsed down
 * to a single delimiter before anything else is parsed, so {@code "todo   read
 * book"} and {@code "todo read book"} are treated identically; the same is
 * true of accidental leading whitespace before the command word itself, e.g.
 * {@code "  todo read book"}. Whitespace inside a command's own arguments
 * (a description, a {@code /by} date) is left untouched beyond a final trim,
 * since it is free text the user typed on purpose.
